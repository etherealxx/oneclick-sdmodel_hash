# oneclick-showmodelhash

One-click Python script to grab hash of a `.ckpt` and `.safetensors` model in a folder, recursively.
Just download the .py file and run it on your Stable Diffusion model folder (or wherever you put your model on).

The main script are directly taken from Auto's Webui. I added the one click part.

I'm still a noob at python who got interested after the Stable Diffusion thing. The code isn't efficient, but it just works.
