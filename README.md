# oneclick-sdmodel_hash
One-click Python script to grab hash of a ckpt model in a folder, recursively.
Just download the .py file and run it on your Stable Diffusion model folder (or wherefer you put your model on).

The code is modified from someone else's. I couldn't found the user or the repository. If i found it i probably will just fork his repo, or requesting git push.

I'm still a noob at python who got interested after the Stable Diffusion thing. The code isn't efficient, but it just works.
